# Subtitle-Shifter
A script in Python to shift the time interval in which subtitles in are to be displayed. You will be prompted to enter the name of the subtitle file and to enter the time by which you wish to delay the interval in HH:MM:SS format. The script outputs the changed subtitle file of the same name as the source subtitle file.  

I hope that someone finds this script useful. It is crappy at present. Will probably refine it in the future. :)
